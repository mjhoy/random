test your git.

usage: git-test path

Looks in `path` recursively for a git repo. Picks a random repo. Picks 
a random commit, and a portion of a diff from that commit. With just the 
partial diff, what repo is this from? (multiple choice.)

todo: a lot.

install: cabal install --prefix=$HOME --user
(installs to ~/bin)
